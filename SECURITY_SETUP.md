# 🚨 URGENT: Supabase Security Setup Required

## IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS (Do These NOW)

### 1. Revoke Compromised API Keys
1. **Go to your Supabase Dashboard**: https://app.supabase.com/project/kyiwpwlxmysyuqjdxvyq
2. **Navigate to**: Settings → API
3. **REVOKE the exposed service role key**: `sbp_6e8a68bf9eff6295771c0abb668f4d79a87174c8`
4. **Generate a NEW service role key**
5. **Also regenerate the anon/public key** (current one is also exposed in code)

### 2. Update Environment Configuration
1. **Edit `.env.local`** in your project root
2. **Replace the placeholder values** with your NEW keys:
   ```bash
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://kyiwpwlxmysyuqjdxvyq.supabase.co
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_new_anon_key_here
   ```

### 3. Restart Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

- ✅ Real-time dashboard statistics
- ✅ Instant notification of data changes

## 🔧 Security Best Practices Implemented

1. **Environment Variables**: Credentials now loaded from `.env.local`
2. **Git Protection**: `.gitignore` prevents committing sensitive files
3. **Error Handling**: Validates environment variables on startup
4. **Access Control**: Role-based data filtering throughout the app

## 🚨 Critical Security Notes

1. **NEVER share API keys publicly again**
2. **Always use environment variables for credentials**
3. **The service role key you shared has FULL DATABASE ACCESS**
4. **Revoke it immediately to prevent unauthorized access**

## 📋 Verification Steps

After updating your environment variables:

1. ✅ Development server starts without errors
2. ✅ User authentication works with proper user accounts
3. ✅ Dashboard loads with real-time data
4. ✅ All admin functions operate normally

## 🔐 User Account Management

Your system uses secure authentication with role-based access control:
- **Super Admin**: Full system access and organization management
- **Org Admin**: Organization-specific management capabilities
- **Manager**: Department-level user and task management
- **Employee**: Personal data and task access only

Create user accounts through the Super Admin dashboard interface.

## 💡 Next Steps

Once you've secured the API keys:
1. Test all functionality to ensure everything works
2. Consider implementing additional security measures:
   - IP whitelisting for admin accounts
   - Rate limiting for login attempts
   - Enhanced 2FA requirements
   - Regular security audits

## 📞 Need Help?

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check browser console for error messages
2. Verify environment variables are loaded correctly
3. Ensure new API keys have proper permissions in Supabase
4. Test with a simple database query to confirm connectivity

**Remember**: Your application architecture is solid - this is purely a credential security issue that needs immediate attention.
