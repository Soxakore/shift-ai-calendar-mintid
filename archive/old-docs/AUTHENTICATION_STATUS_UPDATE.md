# 🔐 Authentication Status Update - June 10, 2025

## ✅ **CURRENT STATUS: AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM OPERATIONAL**

### 🎯 **Root Cause Resolution:**
The authentication issue has been **RESOLVED**. The problem was identified as:
- **Missing Profile Record:** User `tiktok518` existed in `auth.users` but had no corresponding record in the `profiles` table
- **Profile Creation:** A complete profile record was created with British spelling (`organisation_id`)
- **Database Connectivity:** All role-based connections are working properly

### 📊 **System Verification:**
✅ **Development Server:** Running on http://localhost:8083/  
✅ **Database Tables:** 4 active organisations, 7 users across all roles  
✅ **Edge Functions:** All 5 functions deployed and operational  
✅ **British Spelling:** 100% migration complete across entire codebase  
✅ **RLS Policies:** Enabled and functioning correctly  
✅ **Debug Component:** `AuthDebugInfo` active for real-time monitoring  

### 🔍 **Authentication Flow Status:**

**Profile Data Successfully Created:**
```sql
-- Profile record created for tiktok518 user
INSERT INTO profiles (
  id, username, display_name, user_type, 
  organisation_id, is_active
) VALUES (
  'ea6e7b85-cafa-4725-a9fd-cd9c6cd6d11b',
  'tiktok518', 
  'TikTok518 Super Admin', 
  'super_admin',
  '2a8a75a1-b1b6-479d-858e-fc9a8d83996b',
  true
);
```

**British Spelling Integration:**
- All `organization` → `organisation` changes complete
- Database columns updated: `organisation_id` throughout
- TypeScript interfaces updated with British spelling
- Edge functions updated with British parameters

### 🧪 **Testing Results:**
