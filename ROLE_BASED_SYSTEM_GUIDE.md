# Role-Based Access Control System - Complete Guide

## 🎯 Overview

Your WorkFlow AI system now has a complete role-based access control system where:

- **You (Super Admin)** can create accounts for managers and employees
- **Managers** can only see and manage their specific department
- **Employees** can only see their own information
- **All credentials are saved automatically** and persist across sessions

## 🔧 How It Works

### 1. **Account Creation (You do this)**

Go to the admin panel: `http://localhost:8083/admin`

1. Click on the **"Accounts"** tab
2. Fill in the form:
   - **Name**: Full name (e.g., "John Kitchen Manager")
   - **Username**: What they'll type to login (e.g., "john.kitchen")
   - **Password**: What they'll type for password (e.g., "kitchen123")
   - **Role**: Select their role (Manager, Employee, etc.)
   - **Organization**: Which company (McDonald's, Starbucks, etc.)
   - **Department**: Which department (Kitchen, Front Counter, etc.)

3. Click **"Create Account"**
4. Copy the credentials using the copy button
5. Give the username and password to the person

### 2. **How They Log In**

When your managers/employees want to access the system:

1. They go to: `http://localhost:8083/login`
2. They enter their username and password
3. **The system automatically shows them only what they should see**

### 3. **What Each Role Sees**

#### **Kitchen Manager** (Example: username: `kitchen.manager`, password: `kitchen123`)
- ✅ Can see only kitchen employees
- ✅ Can create accounts for kitchen staff
- ✅ Can manage kitchen schedules
- ❌ Cannot see front counter, drive-thru, or other departments
- ❌ Cannot see other organizations

#### **Employee** (Example: username: `mary.cook`, password: `mary123`)
- ✅ Can see their own schedule
- ✅ Can view their own profile
- ❌ Cannot see other employees
- ❌ Cannot create accounts
- ❌ Cannot manage anyone

#### **Organization Admin** (Example: username: `mc.admin`, password: `mcadmin123`)
- ✅ Can see all departments within McDonald's
- ✅ Can manage all McDonald's employees
- ❌ Cannot see Starbucks or other organizations

## 🧪 Test It Right Now

### Ready-to-Use Accounts

I've created these demo accounts you can test immediately:

| Role | Username | Password | What They See |
|------|----------|----------|---------------|
| **Kitchen Manager** | `kitchen.manager` | `kitchen123` | Only kitchen staff in their McDonald's |
| **Employee** | `mary.cook` | `mary123` | Only their own profile and schedule |
| **Org Admin** | `mc.admin` | `mcadmin123` | All McDonald's departments |
| **Super Admin** | `super.admin` | `admin123` | Everything across all organizations |

### How to Test:

1. **Open worker login**: `http://localhost:8083/login`
2. **Try any of the accounts above**
3. **See how each role gets a completely different interface**

## 📱 Step-by-Step Demo

### Test #1: Kitchen Manager
1. Go to `http://localhost:8083/login`
2. Username: `kitchen.manager`
3. Password: `kitchen123`
4. **Result**: You'll see only kitchen-related features and staff

### Test #2: Employee
1. Go to `http://localhost:8083/login`  
2. Username: `mary.cook`
3. Password: `mary123`
4. **Result**: You'll see only personal schedule and profile

### Test #3: Create New Account
1. Go to `http://localhost:8083/admin` (as super admin)
2. Click **"Accounts"** tab
3. Create a new front counter manager
4. Give them the credentials
5. Test their login to see they only see front counter staff

## 🔒 Security Features

### Department Isolation
- Kitchen managers **cannot** see front counter employees
- Front counter managers **cannot** see kitchen employees
- Each department is completely isolated

### Organization Isolation  
- McDonald's managers **cannot** see Starbucks employees
- Each organization is completely separate

### Automatic Role Detection
- No manual setup required after login
- System automatically shows the right interface
- Based on the role assigned during account creation

## 💾 Data Persistence

### Where Credentials Are Stored
- All accounts are saved in browser's `localStorage`
- Survives browser restarts and computer restarts
- No external database needed for demo

### Adding to Real Database
When you're ready for production, you can easily move the account data to:
- Firebase
- MySQL
- PostgreSQL
- Any database you prefer

## 🚀 Next Steps

### For Immediate Use:
1. **Create real accounts** for your actual managers
2. **Give them their credentials**
3. **They can start logging in immediately**

### For Production:
1. **Move from localStorage to a real database**
2. **Add password hashing for security**
3. **Add password reset functionality**
4. **Add email notifications for new accounts**

## 📋 Quick Reference

## ❓ Common Questions

**Q: Can I change someone's role after creating their account?**
A: Yes, delete their account and create a new one with the correct role.

**Q: What happens if I give the same username to two people?**
A: The system will warn you and prevent duplicate usernames.

**Q: Can managers create accounts for other departments?**
A: No, managers can only create accounts for their own department.

**Q: Can I see what interface someone else will see?**
A: Yes! Use the "Role Demo" tab in the admin panel to preview any role.

**Q: Is this secure for production?**
A: For demo purposes, yes. For production, you'll want to add password hashing and move to a real database.

## 🎉 Summary

You now have a complete role-based system where:
1. **You create accounts easily through the admin panel**
2. **Managers automatically see only their department**
3. **Employees automatically see only their own data**
4. **Everything is saved and works across sessions**
5. **No complex setup required - it just works!**

The system does exactly what you requested: managers can give usernames/passwords to their team members, but they can only see and manage people in their specific department, while you have access to everything.
