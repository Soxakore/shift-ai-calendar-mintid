- Git safe points with automated tagging
- Recovery information dashboard

#### Backup System
- Timestamped file backups with metadata
- Multiple backup versions per file
- Smart restore with version selection
- Pre-commit automatic backups

#### Testing Integration

- Complete state reset capabilities

### Workflow Examples

#### Safe Feature Development
```bash
# 1. Create safe point
./surgical-master.sh
# Choose: Quick Workflow → Add New Feature

# 2. Backup before changes
./surgical-enhanced.sh backup src/pages/Index.tsx "Before navigation update"

# 3. Make changes and test
./test-enhanced.sh comprehensive src/pages/Index.tsx

# 4. Commit safely
./surgical-master.sh test-and-commit
```

#### Emergency Recovery
```bash
# If something breaks badly
./surgical-master.sh emergency

# Options:
# 1. Rollback to last working commit
# 2. Rollback to specific safe point
# 3. Restore all files from backups
```
