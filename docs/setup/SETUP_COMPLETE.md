## 🚨 CRITICAL: Security Action Required

**STEP 1: Revoke Exposed Credentials (DO THIS NOW)**
1. Go to [Supabase Dashboard](https://app.supabase.com/project/kyiwpwlxmysyuqjdxvyq/settings/api)
2. **Revoke** the service role key: `sbp_6e8a68bf9eff6295771c0abb668f4d79a87174c8`
3. **Generate new** anon/public key (current one is also exposed)
4. **Generate new** service role key if needed

**STEP 2: Update Environment File**
Edit `/Users/ibe/shift-ai-calendar-mintid/.env.local`:
```bash
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://kyiwpwlxmysyuqjdxvyq.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_new_anon_key_here
```

**STEP 3: Restart Development Server**
```bash
# Kill current server (Ctrl+C) then restart:
npm run dev
```
