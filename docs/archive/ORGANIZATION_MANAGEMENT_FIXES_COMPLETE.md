# 🏢 Organization Management Fixes - Complete Success Report

## Date: June 12, 2025
## Status: ✅ COMPLETE - Both Issues Resolved

---

## 🎯 Issues Addressed

### 1. Department Creation Missing in Organization Management ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Users could not create departments in the Organization Management component, despite this functionality existing in other parts of the application.

**Root Cause**: The `OrganisationManagement.tsx` component only displayed organization details but lacked department creation and management functionality.

**Solution Implemented**:
- ✅ Added department creation dialog with form validation
- ✅ Added comprehensive department management section 
- ✅ Implemented `handleCreateDepartment` function with proper error handling
- ✅ Added department listing with user counts and status badges
- ✅ Included edit and delete buttons for future functionality
- ✅ Added proper loading states and success/error toasts

### 2. British/American Spelling Inconsistency ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: The system inconsistently used "Organization" (American) vs "Organisation" (British) throughout the UI, despite the database schema using British spelling (`organisation_id`).

**Root Cause**: Mixed spelling conventions across multiple components, creating inconsistent user experience.

**Solution Implemented**:
- ✅ Updated all UI components to use British spelling "Organisation" 
- ✅ Updated form labels, placeholders, and error messages
- ✅ Updated button text and titles
- ✅ Updated toast notifications and alerts
- ✅ Maintained database schema consistency
